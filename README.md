# lightauth

This project *SHOULD NOT* be used in production for various reasons. This project is one of our many experiments in learning GO and in this case JSON-RPC, Crypto and JWT for a demo Authentication and Session application. We prefer to learn using something more than the usual 'hello world'.

## Installation

After cloning the repository you need to install the few dependencies. Execute the following within the main directory.

```bash
go get ./...
```

There are three applications - the server is in the 'lightauth' directory, a session generation application (usefu; for generating API tokens with roles such as admin), and a 'user' app for creating users suitable for inclusing in the users.csv file (similar to passwd).
